USGS HUC: h16020204
Surface area, elevation
The drainage area that feeds Red Butte Creek is just over 8 square miles. The canyon itself is around 5.5 miles long with an elevation gain of 3215 feet from the canyon mouth at 5020 feet above sea level to the top of the canyon at 8235 feet.
Geological characteristics
Red Butte Canyon cuts a path down the western slope of the Wasatch Mountain range, which sits at the far eastern edge of the Basin and Range province, as it intersects with the Rocky Mountains above Salt Lake City, UT. While often considered to be the westernmost range of the Middle Rocky Mountains, the Wasatch share structural characteristics of the Basin and Range mountains found to their west. One of these characteristics is the steep normal fault running along their western edge which helped them rise and formed the steep slopes that Red Butte Canyon bisects. The Wasatch are a very young mountain range and are still rising at around 1mm per year, as they have for roughly the past 11 million years.åÊ They are made up of shale and siltstone from the Triassic period.
Red Butte Canyon holds keys to Utah‰Ûªs past, with the oldest rocks present having been formed millions of years ago during the Mississippian Period, when Utah looked very different from today. Over the eons what is now Red Butte Canyon has been a sea of varying depths, as well as a desert, and many landscapes and ecosystems in between. This is evident in the rocks found underlying and protruding from the canyon, most of which are varieties of sandstone, shale, limestone, and quartzite.
These rocks strongly influence the soil profile of Red Butte Canyon, with related soils often found surrounding the rocks units that weathered to create them. These soils vary in depth from just under 8 feet deep to 2 feet or less, with a large variety of grain sizes represented. Ehleringer et. al. (1992) describe them as, ‰ÛÏneutral to slightly basic, [soils] vary in color from brick red to dark brown, with textures generally ranging from sandy to loamy clays.‰Ûù
Water flow
Red Butte Creek is a free-flowing perennial stream from its headwaters near 8200 feet in elevation to around 5400 feet, when it flows into Red Butte Reservoir, then out through Red Butte Garden, and into Salt Lake City. While it is no longer a source of drinking water for the Salt Lake Valley, several recreational areas, such as the pond in Liberty Park, are fed by it. NEON‰Ûªs data collection in Red Butte Creek takes place upstream of the reservoir from an altitude of around 5640 feet to 5460 feet. The water flow in Red Butte Creek is strongly influenced by seasonal trends such as the snowpack and precipitation, and base flow is maintained by groundwater inputs throughout the stream. The water is clear and quite alkaline with a high mineral content and high conductivity. The flow varies dramatically throughout the year and has high year-to-year variability as well. At the United States Geological Survey gauge station, just downstream of NEON‰Ûªs study area, stream discharge has been measured for over 50 years, and has varied from less than one cubic foot per second to over 100 cubic feet per second.
Nearby land management
As with much of the Wasatch Mountains, Red Butte Canyon is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Red Butte Canyon is unique in the area, however, for its designation as a Research Natural Area. With few exceptions, only researchers with prior permission are allowed in the canyon, leaving it more pristine than other canyons and watersheds in the area. In addition, the reservoir in Red Butte Canyon is managed by the Central Utah Water Conservancy District to protect the population of endangered June Sucker (Chasmistes liorus) that have been introduced the lake.
Vegetation
Red Butte Canyon has several distinct plant communities occupying different niches. The mouth of the canyon sits in the Salt Lake Valley, with dominant vegetation reminiscent of that in the rest of the eastern Great Basin. As the canyon rises, it transitions through different vegetative zones until it enters a conifer community that resembles the southern Rocky Mountains.
The grass-forb community at the mouth of the canyon includes Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), Bluebunch Wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), Big Sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata), Antelope Bitterbrush (Pursha tridentata), and Broom Snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae). At the bottom of the canyon lies a riparian zone covered by a canopy of Box Elder (Acer negundo)åÊand Cottonwood (Populus spp.) trees. Under this, numerous smaller trees such as Chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), Dogwood (Cornus sericea), and Water Birch (Betula occidentalis) intermix with Wild Mint (Mentha arvensis), Goldenrod (Salidago spp.), and Horsetails (Equisetum spp.) along the water‰Ûªs edge.
Red Butte Canyon‰Ûªs walls rise out of the riparian zone into a community dominated by Gambel Oak (Quercus gambelii) and Bigtooth Maple (Acer grandidentatum). Oregon Grape (Mahonia repens) spreads under this canopy, and grasses and forbs fill in areas where the canopy breaks letting light through. As the elevation rises, Curl-leaf Mountain Mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) begins to dot the canyon and the oak-maple vegetative zone gives way to one dominated by taller stands of trees. Above this, heartier shrubs and forbs that can handle life high on the mountain surround populations of Aspen (Populus tremuloides), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and White Fir (Abies concolor).

Site history &åÊmanagement
The Onaqui-Benmore area has been grazed by domestic livestock since settlement. By the 1980's, the U.S. Forest Service instituted a light to moderate fall and winter grazing regime that continues today.Fire has always been a component of sagebrush steppe, one of the dominant vegetation types in the area. However, the invasions of exotic annual vegetation, especially Bromus tectorum, also known as drooping brome or cheatgrass, have dramatically shortened fire return intervals. The invasion-fire feedback has resulted in the loss of native perennial species from extensive areas of the region. åÊThe restoration of sagebrush at Onaqui-Ault after the cheatgrass invasion and woodland expansion creates an opportunity to collect data on the changes related to invasive or non-invasive species advancement, as well as the dynamics of rodents and hantavirus.

Santa Rita Experimental Range receives 28-50 cm of rain per year, depending on elevation.åÊ Rainfall is bimodally distributed between winter storms originating in the Pacific Ocean and summer monsoonal moisture stemming from the Gulfs of Mexico and California.åÊ A majority of precipitation falls during intense, short duration summer thunderstorms.åÊ
Site History
Santa Rita Experimental Range was founded in 1903. It is the longest continuously active rangeland research facility and among the five oldest biological field stations in the United States.
The site is broken into distinct pastures, through which cattle graze throughout the year in various densities and durations.åÊ When the monsoon rains begin in early July, cattle are allowed to graze for approximately 10 days in a pasture before moving on, which prevents them from grazing plants a second time during the short summer growing season. Cattle grazing during the dormant season is also carefully managed.
Dominant Vegetation
The current vegetation at Santa Rita Experimental Range is a mix of short trees, shrubs, cacti and other succulents, perennial grasses, and other herbaceous species.åÊ Over the last 100 years, mesquite tree abundance has steadily increased across the range (McClaran 2003).åÊ

Land use at Jornada has contrasting livestock grazing histories (including ungrazed lands), dating back to 1902, which are representative of the pervasive land use in desert-southwest wildlands.åÊHistorical accounts of the region report significant changes in vegetation starting in the late 1800s coincident with the expansion of livestock grazing. By 1912, sufficiently dramatic changes lead area scientists and private landowners to convince the U.S. government to set aside Public Domain Lands for the Jornada Range Reserve for the purpose of scientific investigation on shrub invasion and subsequent loss of forage grasses. Much of this early research focused on quantifying utilization levels for forage species, developing livestock production strategies to deal with drought, and developing methods for shrub control and grass recovery. Exclosures were constructed and long-term plots were established throughout the range to monitor the continued expansion of shrubs across the landscape. Over the decades, numerous trials of various remediation approaches were implemented, from manual and mechanical shrub removal to herbicide application to construction of terraces or other means of redirecting surface flow of runoff.åÊ

Topography, climate, and biota of the site are representative of Rocky Mountain alpine ecosystems, including extensive alpine tundra (mostly herbs, some shrubs and scree) and subalpine coniferous forests (Abies lasciocarpa and Picea engelmanii at higher elevations), talus slopes, wetlands and a variety of glacial landforms.
The site is accessible to the public, is home to the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research project, and is heavily used by researchers. Research themes include the movement of energy and nutrients across the subalpine-alpine landscape, the influence of nitrogen deposition on ecosystems and hydrology, and the influence of climate on diversity and ecosystem function. Alpine plants and animals survive on the edge of environmental tolerances, making them especially sensitive to changes in climate. Changes in the timing, form, and seasonality of precipitation as well as changes in drought frequency and intensity will alter ecosystem structure and function, ultimately leading to changes in species distributions.
High altitude aquatic ecosystems are responsive to external drivers of change, especially climate change and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. The Niwot Ridge terrestrial site is collocated with NEON‰Ûªs D13 core aquatic site, Como Creek, situated at an elevation of 3,030 m in the subalpine.

USGS HUC: h12030101
Surface area, elevation & depth
Pringle Creek is located at an altitude of 242 meters and drains a watershed of 18.1 km2 of mixed oak forest, savanna, and riparian woodland. Portions of the Pringle Creek watershed are protected by the Caddo-LBJ National Grassland.
Geological characteristics
Pringle Creek is a low gradient sandy-bottomed stream. Due to this sandy substrate the stream banks are highly erodible. The primary soils of the Wise County area surrounding Pringle Creek are comprised of gently sloping neutral to slightly acidic soils formed from weathered sandstones and shales on upland and terrace savannahs (Ressel, 1989). The Truce-Cona and Windthorst-Chaney-Seldon series soils of the Pringle Creek watershed are deep, loamy, and sandy moderately well drained to well drained soils underlain by shaly clay, mud,åÊor sand-stone material from the early Cretaceous (USDA, 1989).
Water flow
The surface water flow regime of Pringle Creek has similar attributes that that of semi-arid waterways. Stream discharge exhibits strong seasonal patterns, with the greatest base and pulse flows observed in mid to late spring (May through June). Throughout the rest of the year, base flows remain low but episodic high flow events associated with storms may occur at any point. Areas of the stream dry up significantly during the summer leaving behind disconnected standing pools. This seasonal drying may be exacerbated by nearby ground and surface water withdrawals for irrigation.
Nearby land management
Land use in the Pringle Creek watershed consists of a mosaic of grassland, cropland, light urban development and deciduous forest. The grasslands in the watershed are managed for wildfire using prescribed burns every 3-4 years.
Vegetation
The dense riparian canopy surrounding Pringle Creek is a mixed oak forest. Dominant species of the mixed oak forest area include post oak and black-jack oak. However, the savannah portions of watershed are dominated by little blue stem co-associated with big blue stem and Indiangrass (USDA, 2009).

Several recreational paths actually cross through the field site.
Site History
Yacolt Burn State Forest is named for the dozens of wildfires that ravaged Clark, Cowlitz and Skamania counties in southwest Washington during September 1902. With no organized system for fighting wildfires, the fires spread across nearly 239,000 acres and caused 38 deaths and widespread property losses. An extended period of hot, dry weather; high wind;åÊan over-accumulation of timber harvest slash;åÊand human carelessness are among the frequently cited causes of these fires.åÊIn response, the Washington Legislature established a state fire warden the following year. In 1908, private landowners formed the Washington Fire Protection Association and funded a system of fire wardens and a program of fire prevention on private lands.
The DNR replanted the forests and has maintained the area as working forest in order to:

Protect the long-term health of the forest's ecosytems
Generate revenue for the state
Provide safe, sustainable, and enjoyable recreational opportunities

Site-specific Topics

Located in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains inåÊaåÊyoung forest, ABBY field site provides an interesting comparison to NEON'såÊWREFåÊsite which is located in a nearby old growth forest that is primarily used for research.
Urban growth west of ABBY since the early 2000s has also brought neighborhoods closer to the forest. This growth has increased the demand for a variety of recreational activities. Urban planning is an active component of the land management of this ecosystem.

Vegetation and Soil
The dominant tree species are Douglas Fir which have been planted by the DNR since the Yakolt Burn in 1902.åÊMany shrubs grow in the forest understory, including salal, Oregon-grape, red and big huckleberries, and west coast rhododendron. Dozens of plant species grow on the forest floor, including queencup beadlily, vanilla leaf, bracken fern, beargrass, twinflower, trillium, and little pipsissewa.
Climate
Typical of the Northwest, ABBY experiences very wet falls, winters, and springs; and very dry summers. The nearby Columbia River Gorge affects the valley‰Ûªs climate, contributing to strong winds in any season and cool, wet weather in the winter. Average annual precipitation is about 2,540 mm annually, occurring as rain or snow during fall, winter, and spring. Summers are warm and dry. Cold air draining into the valley can bring frosts almost any time of year.

",7C/44.6F,941 mm,"Evergreen Forest, Shrub/Shrub",2147 m,"Climate
The climate is typical of the Sierra Nevada, with hot, dry summers and fairly mild, wet winters.
The wet season begins in October or November, and most annual precipitation comes in the form of snow during the winter and early spring, with winter snowpack often persisting into late April or May. Temperatures in December through February range from -3 to 12 å¡C (26 to 54 å¡F), with an average around 5 å¡C (41å¡F). Frost is common beginning in mid-October through May or early June. Spring is cool and mild, with average temperatures around 9 å¡C (48 å¡F). Temperatures in June through August range from 10 to 29 å¡C (50 to 84 å¡F) with an average of 20 å¡C (68 å¡F).
Site History and Management
Lower Teakettle is part of the Sierra National Forest, federal public land administered by the U.S. Forest Service. The land is managed for multiple uses and benefits, ranging from renewable resources, such as timber and forage, to recreation and research. Targeted research addresses a range of concerns and provides much of the direction in resource management.
Site-specific Topics The southernmost portion of TEAK overlaps with the Teakettle Experimental Forest, managed by the Pacific Southwest Research Station, which represents the Forest Service Research and Development (FS R&D). Although research at the Experimental Forest historically focused on watershed management and climate science, more recent topics have investigated the effects of fire and thinning treatments on mixed conifer ecosystems. Long-term databases include streamflow and sedimentation, bird census data, and snag distribution and turnover. The Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory maintains a flux tower at Shorthair Creek, the subalpine belt of a tower transect which also includes infrastructure at SJER and SOAP. The Critical Zone Observatory collects data on water, carbon and nutrient cycling across the rain-snow transition in the southern Sierra Nevada.
Vegetation
The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) classifies Lower Teakettle as evergreen forest and shrub scrub vegetation types. At a finer scale, it is a mosaic of closed canopy pine and fir forest, shrub patches, and areas of exposed rock and shallow soil, with occasional wet meadows
punctuating the tree cover. Dominant tree species include red and white fir (Abies magnifica and Abies concolor, respectively), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). Stand structure is diverse, with active recruitment and extensive coarse woody debris. Although dense tree cover limits understory shrubs, bush chinquapin (Chrysolepis sempervirens) often grows on forested slopes. Exposed rock and shallow soils support other shrub species, such mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus), greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula) and pinemat manzanita (Arctostaphylos nevadensis). Open pine and fir forests provide habitat for more shade-tolerant herbaceous plants, whereas meadows, streams and patches of shallow soil accommodate a greater diversity of native grasses, graminoids, and forbs.
Soil
The majority of the site consists of granitic soils common to the Sierra Nevada, primarily from the Cagwin series with smaller contributions from the Sirretta, Stecum and Umpa families, among others. The most common soils have a coarse, sandy texture and are moderately deep with poor water retention. Exposed granitic outcrops are characteristic of the area. There are a few small lakes or ponds at higher elevation in the northern portion of the site, and wet meadows occur intermittently throughout. Perennial and seasonal streams drain into the North Fork of the Kings River.

NEON data will contribute to these studies to help better understand tundra streams, which are rapidly changing along with the Arctic climate.åÊ
Land cover in the Oksrukuyik Creek watershed consists of moist tundra underlain by permafrost. Although dwarf birch and dwarf willow line the banks of Oksrukuyik Creek, these species rarely grow taller than one meter and thus offer little shading.

HydrologyåÊ
Few streams in the NEON network exhibit a flow regime as unique as Oksrukuyik Creek. Discharge falls to zero between October and March, as the stream remains entirely frozen during this period. Discharge rises rapidly following the thaw that occurs between March and June, with catastrophic ice floes and high flow events characterizing this period.åÊåÊ
Discharge remains steady through the summer, with occasional flood events driven by rainstorms. Base discharge steadily decreases from midsummer to early fall as snowmelt declines. As the winter freeze-up begins in September, discharge rapidly approaches zero as any precipitation transitions to snow and remains frozen.åÊåÊ
ChemistryåÊ
Oksrukuyik Creek is an oligotrophic, P-limited tundra stream.åÊ This clear-water stream drains several lakes and has little natural spring or glacial influence. The majority of nutrient fluxes occur during summer months, during times of snowmelt and summer base flow. Stream nutrient inputs are dominated by overland and subsurface flows. Hyporheic exchange is important for nutrient cycling in these ecosystems, and the size of the hyporheic zone is dictate by the spatial and temporal extent of the permafrost thaw.åÊ åÊåÊ
Biology
Oksrukuyik Creek has been studied for several years as part of the Arctic LTER Streams project. This stream, like other tundra streams on the North Slope, freezes solid during winter. The fauna of the stream, invertebrates (e.g., Baetis spp., Brachycentrus sp., Orthocladius spp.) need to adapt to life histories that can withstand freezing conditions, including diapause or ‰ÛÏantifreeze‰Ûù compounds, and fish to migrate to deep lakes or rivers during winter.åÊ
The Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) is found in the stream, however slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) may also be present.åÊ Plant life includes liverworts (Solenostoma sp.) and bryophytes (Schistidium agassizii), and filamentous algae includes the red alga Draparnaldia and Cyanophyte Spirogyra (Harvey et al. 1998).åÊ

",10C/50F,1246 mm,"Evergreen Forest, Shrub/Shrub",1160 m,"Climate
The climate is typical of the Sierra Nevada, with hot, dry summers and fairly mild, wet winters. Precipitation occurs primarily in the form of rain during the winter and early spring, with limited snowfall. Temperatures in December through February range from 1 to 12 å¡C (34 to 54 å¡F), with an average of 6 å¡C (43 å¡F). Frost is common beginning in mid-November through early March. Spring is mild, with average temperatures around 10 å¡C (50 å¡F). The summer months of June through August range from 15 to 28 å¡C (59 to 82 å¡F), with an average of 22 å¡C (72 å¡F), though temperatures often reach or exceed 32 å¡C (90 å¡F) during the day.
Site History and Management
Soaproot Saddle is part of the Sierra National Forest, federal public land administered by the U.S. Forest Service. The land is managed for multiple uses and benefits, ranging from renewable resources, such as timber and forage, to recreation and research. Targeted research addresses a range of concerns and provides much of the direction in resource management. Wildland fire is of particular concern atåÊSOAP, where foresters use a combination of prescribed fire and mechanical fuel treatment to minimize damage while maintaining a healthy fire regime.
Site-specific Topics SOAP is home to a flux tower associated with the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (CZO), which collects data on water, carbonåÊandåÊnutrient cycling across the rain-snow transition in the southern Sierra Nevada. CZO eddy covariance flux towers also operate at the Pacific Southwest core site, San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) and Lower Teakettle (TEAK), the other relocatable site.
Vegetation
The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) characterizes SOAP as a mix of evergreen forest and shrub scrub vegetation types. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) dominate the overstory, with co-dominant canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii). However, the interaction of long-term drought and warming has exacerbated the outbreak of pine bark beetles, leading to high Ponderosa pine mortality and a potential shift in the forest community. Mariposa manzanita
(ArctostaphylosåÊviscidaåÊssp. mariposa) are interspersed throughout the understory and often form dense thickets in open areas, whereasåÊdeerbrushåÊ(CeanothusåÊintegerrimus) and poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum)åÊareåÊcommon in the shaded understory. Mountain misery (ChamaebatiaåÊfoliolosa) provides dense groundcover throughout much of the site. Herbaceous plants include annual and perennial grasses, as well as a range of native forbs.
Soil
Soils are weathered from granite or granodiorite, primarily from the Holland and Chaix series, and to a lesser extent, the Chawankee and Tollhouse series. Soils are moderately deep and well-drained on mountain slopes, with shallower and excessively drained soils on steeper slopes. Exposed bedrock punctuates the landscape. Intermittent streams of the watershed drain into Big Creek, just north of the site boundary and home to the domain‰Ûªs relocatable aquatic site.

The SJER is managed cooperatively by theåÊPacific Southwest Research StationåÊandåÊCalifornia State University's Agricultural Foundation. In 1934, SJER was established as California's first range research station. It was originally conceived as a cooperative interdisciplinary research center to identify cost-effect methods of commercial livestock production in the annual grass-oak pine woodlands, while maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem.
Vegetation
The SJER contains open woodland dominated by blue and interior live oaks and California Foothills pine (Pinus sabiniana) with scattered shrubs and nearly continuous cover of herbaceous plants. Swales occur in low areas between rises. Dominant shrub species include ceanothus (bothåÊwedgeleaf ceanothusåÊandåÊchaparral whitehorn) and manzanita. åÊHerbaceous plants are generally annuals including grasses (e.g., pine bluegrass soft chess, foxtail fescue), and various legumes. Perennials, primarily rushes, are found in the bottomlands. Native perennial bunchgrasses are uncommon and occur on north slopes.
Climate
The climate is Mediterranean. Winters are cool and wet, with frequent frosts and monthly mean temperatures between 4 and 10 å¡C. åÊThe area drains into a small tributary of the San Joaquin River. åÊSummers are hot and dry, with maximum daily temperatures commonly exceeding 38 å¡C and monthly mean temperatures ranging from 24 to 27 å¡C.
Soils
Bedrock is mainly granitic. Soils on slopes are shallow, residual, and granitic and generally of the Ahwahnee series. Soils in swales are deeper, alluvial and generally of the Visalia series. Slope and swale soils have a relatively low water-holding capacity. Granitic outcrops are common on slopes.

Site-specific topics
NEON‰Ûªs science focus for the Pacific Southwest is on a climate gradient, extending from the core site in the oak woodland at the SJER, up through an elevation gradient into mixed conifer and red fir forests. The low density of cattle, light grazing management and fire management are also representative of land use practices throughout the extent of this ecosystem. This core site provides:

A representative wildland to contrast the design of the relocatable sites
Statistical power for regional-scale understanding
A robust design to address expected future changes in climate that are, in turn, expected to influence biodiversity, biogeochemistry, and infectious and invasive species biology

Research history
Databases maintained at the SJER include:

Long-term climate information
Publications based on information acquired at the forest
Spring bird counts beginning in the mid-1980s
Long-term acorn production censuses
Grazing intensity information.

Surface area, elevation & depth
Suggs Lake is an isothermal, mesotrophic lake 0.73 km2 in area and situated at an altitude of 29 m. It has a maximum depth of 5.7 m and a mean depth of 2.5 m.
Geological characteristics
Suggs lake is classified as a clastic upland lake with substrates composed generally of clays and organics.åÊThe limestone geology is overlain by a variable mixture of sand, gravel, clay, phosphate, and carbonate deposited during the Pleistocene interglacials.åÊ
Water flow
Suggs Lake is primarily surface water dominated, although it does interact with the regional aquifer to some extent. This lake lies within a greater flow through wetland complex. Inflow lies on the SW part of the lake with a smaller inflow from the E edge of the lake. Outflow is through the NW part of the lake as part of the greater wetland complex. Suggs Lake is classified as a seepage lake dominated by groundwater flow with the local aquifer, but it is also fed by the local surface and subsurface flow through the wetland complex.åÊThere is no discernible inflow or outflow to Suggs Lake, although there is some evidence of water inflow from the south western edge of the lake with a flow pattern to the N and NW. Suggs Lake is a seepage lake and due to its formation by solution processes, there is a strong link between the lake and the groundwater. In areas where the potentiometric surface of the Floridan aquifer system is at a higher altitude than the water table of the surficial aquifer that overlies it, water moves upward toward the land surface. These areas are referred to as discharge areas or areas of artesian flow.
Nearby land management
Regular prescribed burns are typical in this region.
Vegetation
Lake Suggs has large areas of emergent macrophytes, and is surrounded by cypress swamps and old pastures. The swamps and adjacent hardwood forests are dominated by Bald Cycpress (Taxodium distichum), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), water oak (Quesrcus nigra) and slash pine. The diatom or assemblage is dominated by planktonic forms, notablyåÊM. herzogiiåÊandåÊAterionella ralfsii.åÊ
Biological characteristics
Lake Suggs has a dense population of salamanders, with other common species of amphibians including greater siren (Siren lacertina), lesser siren (Siren intermedia), two-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma means), one-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma pholeter), narrow-striped dwarf siren (Pseudobranchus axanthus), the broad-striped dwarf siren (Pseudobranchus striatus) and the pig frog (Rana grylio).
Chemistry
Suggs Lake has been sampled for chemical constituents weekly since the 1970‰Ûªs. Seasonal variability in chemical parameters is largely controlled by the surrounding wetlands and hydrology. Suggs Lake is a high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lake with an average concentration of 20 mg L -1. Due to the high DOC content, the lake is rather acidic with a pH of 4.74.and an acidity of 15.10 mg CaCO3 L -1. Low oxygen levels are common, with common values around 5.60 mg L -1. The lake is characterized by a Chlorophyll a concentration of 4 ë_g L -1. NEON will contribute to this long-term stream chemistry data set through 12 lake water grab samples annually and continuous sensor data over 30 years. Such chemical measurements along with other NEON-generated data on terrestrial chemical parameters will enable novel investigations in ecohydrology and cross system studies.

Stream Description
Despite the large watershed size (2,875 kilometers2), the Arikaree is a small, wadeable stream that drains tall-grass prairie and flows through a sand-alluvial basin. The stream is largely fed by surface precipitation and is subject to flooding when large, localized storms occur in the watershed. The Arikaree flows primarily during the winter, and often dries completely during summer due to dry conditions and groundwater withdrawals for irrigation.åÊ

The Arikaree site is located on Nature Conservancy land that is maintained as an active cattle ranch but is also managed to ensure a diverse tall-grass prairie and bird community persists.
Site Specific Topics
NEON collects a standard suite of aquatic data at Arikaree; however, data collected at this site captures regional hydrological change and may lead to a better understanding of climate change trends in the area.
Vegetation
Land cover at the Arikaree site is dominated by grasslands with a few trees located near the stream edge. Cottonwood trees cover 30% of the ground in the surrounding area; willow trees cover 10% at the stream bank. During mid-summer, the stream channel is dominated by cattails (Typha sp.).

Before establishment of the no-till cropping systems, the site was under conventional tillage since it was taken from native sod in about 1910. Conventional tillage from 1910 to 1985 ranged from moldboard plowing in the early years to sweep tillage in the later years. The primary crop was winter wheat grown in a wheat-fallow rotation. Proso millet also had been grown occasionally during a few years before 1985. Cropping systems under no-till management were initiated in 1985. These systems included:

Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow
Winter wheat-maize (Zea mays L.)-fallow
Winter wheat-maize-proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.)-fallow
Continuous cropping (crops grown over the years included maize, sorghum, winter wheat, forage millet, and sunflower)

",5C/41F,782 mm,"Deciduous Forest, Evergreen Forest, Mixed Forest, Woody Wetlands",472 m,"History
From the mid 1800‰Ûªs until about 1930, the land was heavily harvested and burned with extensive cutovers and destructive wildfires. Farming was attempted on the cutover land and the open areas were subsequently grazed and mowed until the mid1950s.
In the 1950‰Ûªs the property came under new ownership and a detailed management plan was developed calling for reforestation, sustainable timber harvest, and timber stand improvements. The new owners undertook extensive reforestation, planting nearly140000 trees, and gave the property its current name, Treehaven. In 1979, 850 acres were donated to the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and the university has since expanded to 1400 acres through additional purchases and donations. Since acquiring the land in 1979, UWSP students and staff have used the site to study forest vegetation, fire history ,watersheds, and soils, In addition, forest improvement practices (timber harvest, thinning, and planting) have occurred on nearly 500 acres.
Vegetation
Most of the forests on the property are second growth forests which naturally regenerated after extensive fires and grazing were excluded from the site; however, there are a few, isolated, large diameter trees that pre-date the period of heavy timber harvest. Lowland areas consist of black spruce/tamarack and non-forested acid bog environments, along with a mix of sedge, shrub, hardwood and cedar wetlands. Upland sites are primarily composed of aspen, white birch, and red maple, with a lesser area of mixed red pine, white pine, white spruce, and balsam fir. Red pines planted under the 1956 management plan are prominent along roads throughout the property. A minor component of northern hardwoods and hemlock hardwoods are also present in smaller area, especially on the western edge of the property. Management activities in the proximity of NEON‰Ûªs tower currently are geared to the promotion of sugar maple.
Climate
Treehaven‰Ûªs climate is typical of northern to north-central Wisconsin. It is a humid continental climate with warm summers and no dry season. The warm season lasts from approximately mid-May to mid-September with the warmest temperatures typically in July (average high 79 F). The cold season lasts from November to March with the coldest temperatures typically in January (average low 4 F). The annual average temperature is 41.6 F, and temperatures rarely drop below -17 F or above 87 F.
Average rainfall is 31.49 inches and snowfall is average snowfall is approximately 62 inches per year. Wind speeds are typically calm to moderate, rarely exceeding 20 mph.
Daylight hours vary significantly throughout the course of the year with the longest day in June having 15:42 hours of daylight and the shortest day in December having 8:41 hours of daylight.

Surface area, elevation & depth
Crampton Lake is approximately 26 hectares surface area. The max depth is about 17.5 meters and average depth around 5 m. Structurally, there are two significant bays and one island. There are two deep holes which account for the max depth while much of the bottom is 1-10 m deep. Crampton Lake is at approximately 591 m altitude.
Hydrology and Geology
Crampton Lake is a seepage lake, with no significant surface water inlet or outlet. It is primarily rain-fed, with some contribution from groundwater. There is a small, slowly flowing inlet from a bog on the northeast edge.
Crampton is generally completely ice covered from about late November until late March. It stratifies annually a few weeks after ice off. The mean depth of the metalimnion is roughly 4 to 9 meters. The lake destratifies in early November. Average secchi depth is around 4.5 meters.
The substrate is mostly organic muck, silt, and sand. There are areas where gravel is also common. Crampton has a more complicated topography than the typical kettle lake in the region, but was also carved by retreating glaciers of the Laurentide Ice Sheet about 18,000 years ago.åÊ The bedrock is a migmatitic gneiss and amphobole dating from the late to early Archean.
Biology
The near-shore emergent aquatic vegetation is dominated by pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), which covers much of the shore. At slightly deeper depths (up to approximately 4 m) bur-reed grass (Sparganium angustifolium) dominates at the surface. Other emergent and floating-leafed plants include pond lilies (Nymphaea odorataåÊandåÊNupharåÊsp.) and several pondweeds (PotamogetonåÊspp.). Three-way sedge (Dulichium arundinaceum), a mostly terrestrial species, also occurs in the lake. Submerged vegetation includes two species of quillwort (Isoetes lacustrisåÊandåÊI. tenella), pipewort (Eriocaulon aquaticum), dwarf watermilfoil (Myriophyllum tenellum), water lobelia (Lobelia dortmanna), and at least one species of macro-algae (NitellaåÊsp.).
Fish species include largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), yellow perchåÊ(Perca flavescens), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), bluntnose minnow (Pimephales sp.), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), and johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum).
Chemistry
Crampton Lake is a clear water, oligotrophic lake. The dissolved oxygen near the surface is very high, generally above 95%. Conductivity near the surface is between 13 and 15 microsiemens per cm. Water temperature in mid-summer is roughly 24 degrees Celsius. After destratification, water temperature is around 6 degrees Celsius throughout.
The waters of Crampton are neutral, with a pH of about 6.5. It has extremely low ionic strength and is sensitive to slight changes of acidity. The alkalinity and ANC (acid neutralizing capacity) tend to be between 0.15 and -0.05 meq/L or between 6 and -3 mg/L CaCO3.
Nearby Land Use and Vegetation
For general area land use and vegetation characteristics, seeåÊUNDERCåÊfield site specific description.
Crampton Lake‰Ûªs immediate shore is dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga Canadensis), white cedar (Picea glauca), and red maple (Acer rubrum). Also present are red pine (Pinus resinosa) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea).

The Steigerwaldt tower site is managed for timber production and recreation. It is a young, even-aged stand, with aspen (Populus tremuloides), red maple (Acer rubrum), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) among the most abundant tree species. The stand was cut in 2005, with some scattered oak and hemlock left for wildlife food and roost. It has approximately 4000 aspen stems per hectare, naturally regenerated from roots. Roads are planted with clover asåÊadditionalåÊfood source for deer and ruffed grouse.
The NEON study area in the CHEQ Park Falls District encompasses a diversity of forest stands. The area includes pine, hemlock, aspen, northern hardwoods, including CCC-planted red and jack pine plantations. Logging is active in the area, although different management systems may vary. The CNNF Park Falls District‰Ûªs timber program has recently been dominated by salvage timber projects following ice and hail damage, windstorms, tornadoes, and spruce decline, followed by a recent focus in over-mature aspen stands in both Price and Taylor County. Over the last several years, the District has been moving out of salvage mode with recently approved vegetation management / forest health projects in pine and hardwood management areas.åÊ Early successional habitat also continues to be a focus
Climate
Climate at both the Steigerwaldt tower site and the CHEQ distributed plot site is typical of northern to north-central Wisconsin. It is a humid continental climate with warm summers and no dry season. The warm season lasts from approximately mid-May to mid-September with the warmest temperatures typically in July (average high 79 F).

Surface area, elevation & depth
Barco Lake is 0.12 km2åÊin surface area, at an elevation of 28 m and sits within a 0.9 km2åÊwatershed.åÊBarco Lake has a maximum depth of 7.1 m and a mean depth of 4.3 m.
Water Flow
Barco Lake is a typical lentic water body without significant surface inflows or outflows. Instead, water may be largely derived from lateral groundwater seepage through the surrounding well-drained uplands and/or from artesian sources via connections with the underlying limestone aquifer. There is no discernible inflow or outflow to Barco Lake, although there is some evidence of water inflow from the northern edge of the lake with a flow pattern to the S and SE. Virtually all the water inflow to Barco Lake is groundwater, with up to 8 inches per year: the main flow of groundwater is NE to SW andåÊgroundwater flow is downward beneath most of Barco Lake. Fluctuation in the water table is generally between 1 to 1.5 m but can reach up to 3 to 4 m during storm event.
Vegetation
The immediate watershed of Barco Lake is characterized by a forest of widely spaced pine trees (Pinus clauda) and a sparse understory of deciduous oaks. Fairly dense ground cover of grasses and herbs is typical of these environments. Fire is a dominant factor in the ecology of this community.
Biological characteristics
Common animals include tiger salamander, barking treefrog, spadefoot toad, gopher frog, gopher tortoise, worm lizard, fence lizard, mole skink, indigo snake, coachwhip snake, pine snake, short-tailed snake, crowned snake, eastern diamondback rattlesnake, bobwhite, ground dove, red-headed woodpecker, rufous-sided towhee, fox squirrel and pocket gopher. Barco Lake is an important breeding areas for terrestrial amphibians, including the threatened gopher frog, as well as many unusual or endemic insects, as well as an important watering holes for a number of mammals and birds, including ducks and wading birds.
Chemistry
Barco Lake is an oligotrophic acidic lake (pH 4.5). The lake is clear with a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of ~ 2 mg L -1 . The water chemistry is highly influenced by the rainwater and interactions with groundwater. Total phosphorous and nitrate concentrations are ~ 39 ë_g L -1 and 14 ë_g L -1 , respectively, and SO4 2- ~ 2.18 mg L -1 . Chlorophyll a concentration is ~ 2.74 ë_g L -1 (James, 1991). Upgradient of Barco Lake the water remains oxic as it moves downward. Downgradient of Barco Lake, the oxic groundwater mixes with lakewater leakage in a highly reducing (methanogenic, low-sulfide), silicate-carbonate mineral environment.
Geological characteristics
Estimated to be at least 1000 years old,åÊBarco Lake is classified as a lentic sandhill upland lake underlain by sandy substrate and organic deposits that increase with depth.åÊIt is underlain by the Floridan Aquifer dominated by a limestone and dolomite geology. The limestone geology is overlain by a thick mixture of sand, gravel, clay, phosphate, and carbonate deposited during the Pleistocene interglacials.

At the SCBI, the forest was logged multiple times during the past 300 years and was managed mostly as farmland when acquired by the federal government in 1903. One reason that wildlands are found disproportionately in the mountain province of the domain is that the steep slopes and shallow soils are relatively unproductive for agriculture. Here too the site is typical of the domain, encompassing the full range of lithologic, edaphic, hydrologic, and biogeochemical conditions found in the Mid-Atlantic Domain.
Vegetation
(SCBI)åÊsiteåÊconsists of mature (> 100åÊyear) and young (< 40åÊyear) secondary forest that is primarily deciduous and indicative of hardwood forests in the Middle Atlantic Domain. This forest is Eastern Deciduous and dominated by oak, hickory, ashåÊandåÊtulip popular. Young forests are dominated by white ash, black locust, and dogwood. Invasive tree species (autumn olive, tree-of-heaven, princess tree) are present along edges and disturbed sites.

Exogenous factors likely to affect forest growth and composition into the future include climate change, increasing regional rates of atmospheric deposition (S, N and Hg), and new invasive species, such as the hemlock wooly adelgid, emerald ash borer, and Asian long horned beetle, whose ranges are likely to expand within the region. Bartlett Experimental Forest also represents the most Northeastern NEON site, and anchors the top of the north-south nitrogen deposition gradient along the eastern-side of the US.
Vegetation
The Bartlett site is primarily Eastern Deciduous, boreal ecotone. Nearly all of the Bartlett Experimental Forest is now covered by high forest. The primary forest cover type is the sugar maple-beech-yellow birch type. The upper elevations support stands of spruce and fir. Softwoods such as hemlock, balsam fir and spruce are commonly mixed with hardwoods, especially on cool steep slopes or on the poorly drained soils at lower elevations. Although white pine occurs mostly in stands at lower elevations, scattered specimens can be found over a large part of the forest. The site provides the deciduous-to-boreal forest transitional ecotone towards the ecosystems in the North.

",4C/39.2F,520 mm,Evergreen Forest,2743 m,"Conversion of native vegetation to urban and suburban landscapes drastically alters biological diversity, reduces soil organic matter, and alters the distribution of plant biomass over time and space. Yet little is known about the ecosystem processes (e.g., carbon fluxes, nutrient dynamics) associated with residential land cover within this domain.

",5C/41F,490 mm,"Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands, Grassland/Herbaceous",579 m,"Site location description
The Northern Plains-Woodworth site is located at ~ 3 miles SE of the town of Woodworth, ND. åÊThe Northern Plains-Woodworth site is part of the Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge and is at the center of one of the largest roadless blocks of native prairie left in the Upper Great Plains.
Site history & management
This site has been restored to native vegetation, structureåÊandåÊfunction.
Site specificåÊtopics & science rationale
Woodworth provides a baseline understanding of a core wildland system that is historically representative of the region and providesåÊmeaningfulåÊcomparison to the other sites in the region that are managed with different degrees of grazing intensity. While there is little urban development in the area, this site is paired with other grassland sites within the NEON continental design: itåÊprovides a contrast to sites that may receive chemical climate inputs from agronomic practices, as well as sitesåÊfrom nearby growing urban environments.åÊThe Woodworth site also provides an understanding of tall grass prairie environments andåÊserves as a benchmark for detecting and exploring the causes and consequences of environmental change taking place throughout the grasslands of the Northern Plains Domain, with results relevant to semi-arid grassland ecosystems worldwide. åÊ
Vegetation
Woodworth contains a mix of native grasslands, tame grasses and legumes with many species of wildflowers, and unique xeric (dry) mixed-grass prairies containing a plant community unique to North Dakota and the Great Plains.åÊ
Biological conditions
Overall, the Northern Plains-Woodworth site retains most of the features representative of pre-settlement biotic and edaphic conditions, with large native herbivores. The Refuge and surrounding area also provides breeding and resting habitat for more than 293 bird species, and has been designated as one of America's Top 100 Globally Important Bird Areas (IBA) by the American Bird Conservancy.

",,,,,GRSM,Relocatable Terrestrial,,National Park Service,Complete,,Complete,,Ongoing,,Partially Available,,Complete,,"Great Smoky Mountains National Park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, the lower section in latitude of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which divides the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The border between Tennessee and North Carolina runs northeast to southwest through the centerline of the park. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.
Site history & management
The park was chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1934 and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. It encompasses 814 square miles (2,108 kmå_), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern U.S.It was the first national park whose land was paid for in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds. It is the most visited national park in the U.S., and on its route from Maine to Georgia, the Appalachian Trail also passes through the center of the park.

",13C/55.4F,1396 mm,"Deciduous Forest, Evergreen Forest",579 m,"Climate
The park normally has very high humidity and precipitation, averaging from 55 inches (1,400 mm) per year in the valleys to 85 inches (2,200 mm) per year on the peaks. This area receives more annual rainfall than anywhere else in the U.S. outside of the Pacific Northwest and parts of Alaska. Most of the park has a humid continental climate more comparable to locations much farther north, as opposed to the humid subtropical climate in the lowlands.
Topography
Elevations in the park range from 876 feet (267 m) at the mouth of Abrams Creek to 6,643 feet (2,025 m) at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains are greater than 6,000 feet (1,829 m). The wide range of elevation mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern U.S.
Vegetation
The park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, 187,000 acres (760 km2), is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area. It is one of the largest stands of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America. Over 100 species of trees grow in the park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser Fir. In addition, the park has over 1,400 flowering plant species and over 4,000 species of non-flowering plants.

Wind Direction:
The dominant wind direction is northwest.
Biological characteristics
The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give Great Smoky Mountain Park an unusual richness of biota. About 10,000 species of plants and animals are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present. Park officials count more than 200 species of birds, 66 species of mammals, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders. The park has a noteworthy black bear population, numbering at least 1,800. An experimental reintroduction of elk (wapiti) into the park began in 2001. During the most recent ice age, the northeast-to-southwest orientation of the Appalachian mountains allowed species to migrate southward along the slopes rather than finding the mountains to be a barrier. As climate warms, many northern species are now retreating upward along the slopes and withdrawing northward, while southern species are expanding.
Site-specific topics
Biodiversity along elevational gradients respond to climatic change in various ways. A key attribute in choosing Great Smoky is that it provides robust conditions to test ecological theory in the controls of biodiversity movement and change in species composition and associated ecosystem processes.
