##### Obtain a data product manually from NEON

Download NEON products out of app through NEON's [search portal](http://data.neonscience.org/static/browse.html). While this option isn't recommended, it may be needed to find datasets and ranges that aren't included in the first two options (e.g. a range of 3 months, for sites 'ABBY' and 'SRER').

This manual download should be in the form of a zip file. Due to limitations with `R Shiny`'s `selectInput`, for step 2 to work **this zip file must be stored in the directory containing Calliope View**.
