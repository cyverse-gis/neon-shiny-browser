The CyVerse NEON Browser is a multifunctional R Shiny tool designed to make NEON data accessible, visible, and easy to interact with. Commissioned by the <a href='https://www.cyverse.org/' target='_blank'>CyVerse</a> initiative, this application attempts to highlight the best of <a href='https://www.neonscience.org/' target='_blank'>NEON</a> and improve its user experience. By combining the <a href='https://shiny.rstudio.com/' target='_blank'>R Shiny</a> platform, community resources, and NEON's services, this project brings together the essential parts of NEON into one multifaceted tool.

### Origin

As an academic organization that promotes data-driven discovery and provides public cyberinfrastructure to scientists, NEON and this project fall squarely within CyVerse's mission. Attempting to further advance NEON's community-based philosophy, the CyVerse NEON Browser was one of the first apps to be unveiled on CyVerse's Interactive Discovery Environment (VICE), which hosts scientitic applications publically to make them more accessible. The app, which deals with purely NEON, actually traces its origin back to the project "Calliope View" which displays drone imaging alongside ecological data (hence, NEON). Throughout the developement of Calliope View, we realized that the features implemented to display and pull NEON data were very useful, and as a result we created this stand-alone tool.

### Creation

This application pulls heavily from existing resources developed across the NEON and data science communities. As Tyson Swetnam (the leader of this project) stated, it took an "epic amount of labor" from NEON to collect their data and create their Data API, and just as much work from the RShiny community to provide hundreds of thousands of lines of pre-written code. For example, this application rests on the R language and the R Shiny framework, and uses a multitude of packages to aid the maps, layouts, and downloads found inside. Specifically, the interactive map is created by <a href='https://leafletjs.com/' target='_blank'>leaflet</a> (<a href='https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/' target='_blank'>for R</a>), with its contents and geometries coming from NEON's API and spatial resources. The Data Browser combines <a href='https://github.com/ropensci/nneo' target='_blank'>nneo</a>, a community package, and <a href='https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-utilities' target='_blank'>NEON Utilities</a>, a tool developed by NEON itself, to bring the product catalog and options to download. By connecting all of these aspects into one platform, users who may not be familiar with data science can reap all of the advantages that it offers in terms of accessing NEON data.

### Goal

This app provides many useful features to anyone ranging from a student researcher to a full-time ecologist. While the <a href='https://www.neonscience.org/' target='_blank'>NEON website</a> will always be the ultimate destination for information, oppotunities, or more advanced requests, this application is a functional tool meant to satisfy basic interactions with NEON services. Specifically, the app's unified platform hopes to simplify the NEON experience by aggregating many of the more advanced features and making them accesible to those without the time or the programming experience. For example, all downloads come stacked, meaning that the data products arrive already unzipped, joined, and grouped by table type. While one could download from the <a href='http://data.neonscience.org/home' target='_blank'>NEON Data Portal</a>, and then use an R package to apply the same process to their downloads, that requires multiple steps and some basic knowledge of programming and R; the CyVerse NEON Browser, on the other hand, does this automatically, saving time and learning for those who want it. Similarly, a visit to the NEON website yields a data browser and interactive map in different locations (and entirely separate domains), making it potentially confusing for a newcomer to grasp the basics of NEON and be able to find all services that augment NEON data. This tool, conversely, combines basic approximations of the map and data browser, offering similar information and capabilities from one contained platform. Through these measures, the CyVerse NEON Browser hopes to act as a complement to the structure that NEON has already created, increasing its reach and impact in the world of ecology and beyond.
