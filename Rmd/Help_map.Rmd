## Map

The interactive map, located on the left side of the app, is the way to explore NEON field sites. The leaflet map is interactive, meaning that you can zoom in, interact with layers, and change the "tile" (type of map) that you are viewing. The map itself contains four tiles:
* Basic: The basic street map
* Satellite
* Nat Geo: The national geographic map
* Topo: Topographic map

Plotted on these tiles are the various NEON elements. Learn how to take advantage of the map and use it to explore NEON field sites through this guide. Click on the tabs below to navigate through the various topics:
