## NEON

This section will explain NEON's services in relation to this app (more on NEON's project and mission can be found <a id='about_NEON' href='#' class='action-button'>here</a>).

NEON is primarily focused on the collection and dissemination of ecological data. This data comes in the form of almost 180 data products across multiple sites that are all available for download. These "standardized and QA/QCed data products include meteorological, soil, organismal, biogeochemical, freshwater aquatic and remote sensing data", ranging from products like <a href='http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.00004.001' target='_blank'>Barometric Pressure</a> to <a href='http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.20063.001' target='_blank'>Aquatic plant bryophyte chemical properties </a>.

### Field Sites
NEON's data distribution starts with their field sites. These 81 sites (47 terrestrial and 34 aquatic) are the places where NEON collects data; they are strategically located and scattered across the United States to reflect the ecosystem of the US as a whole, and to capture a diverse range of environments and climates. They are divided into 20 ecoclimatic domains, and categorized into 4 groups: Core/Relocatable and Terrestrial/Aquatic. These sites, which the NEON download structure is organized around, are central to NEON data. Field sites determine both the location and the ecosystem that data is coming from, making them very important in finding the appropriate data for your analyses. This is where the NEON Shiny Browser's interactive map comes in; the map allows you to find field sites and view plots and locations within them, all from one spot.

### Finding Data
The next important step involves finding a data product. From the almost 180 data products available, only some will be relevant to your project or research. Additionally, it is important to navigate through the different types of products, and find the time ranges that are available for each (these are broken down into year-month combinations; for example, May 2018). The NEON Shiny Browser provides a data browser with a product catalog and accompanying information and availability for each product. There are filters to help narrow down product options and information detailing the contents and design of each product.

### Downloading data

The last, obvious step involves downloading data for use. The NEON Shiny Browser provides a platform to download this data using a "product ID" associated with each product, along with the desired field site and the time period of the data. Each download will include data in its appropriate structure (CSVs being the most common), and these downloads come directly from the NEON API to your computer.
